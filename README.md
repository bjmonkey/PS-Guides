# PS-Guides Sketch plugin

Quickly generate Guides for a selected element.
It is tedious to create guides for a layer using sketch's default layout setting, so this my attempt to ease that effort.

## Install

*PS-Guides supports Sketch 3.8+* ([why?] Because I haven't tested in older versions! :P)

1. [Download the ZIP](http://guides.pratikshah.website/download.php)
2. Unzip, open the folder and double click `PS Guides.sketchplugin`
3. Restart Sketch

## Change the keyboard shortcuts

If youâ€™re not a fan of the keyboard shortcuts PS-Guides ships with, you can change them in `System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts`. Add a new item for Sketch.app named either `Setup Guides` or `Clear Guides` and create a new one.

## Notes

- Material and/or Bootstrap column layout is the most widely used standard for designs.
- This came to be because I felt that there isn't a clean solution available to do grids for layers (and I had no plans on a Weekend).
